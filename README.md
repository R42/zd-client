# Part2 - Road to Part3

### Objective: Add client-side routing

Create two more views:

- **WelcomeView**
	- Does not need a model
	- Renders an text input field for the nickname and a link to `#play`
- **RankingView**
	- Renders a list with the top players from a synced `Ranking` (collection)
	
Create a [router](http://backbonejs.org/#Router) and define three routes:

- `'#'` -- a root route that shows the `WelcomeView`
- `'#game'` -- picks the nickname set in `WelcomeView`, sets it in the `Game` model and shows the `GameView`
- `'#rankingÂ´` -- shows the `RankingView`

Add a link somewhere in the HTML for `#ranking`.
